With participation from institutions across Africa – including Ghana, Kenya, Rwanda, and Tanzania – and international collaborators from Germany, Italy, and the UK, the conference emphasised the exchange of experiences, methodologies, and the impact of STACK integration. Key discussions centred on developing a certification framework for novice STACK users, the expansion of [IDEMS' Open Question Banks](https://ecampus.idems.international/course/index.php?categoryid=58), and strategic planning for the institutionalisation of STACK across African universities. The conference highlighted Africa’s potential to lead in digital assessment innovations and provided a forum for peer review and strategic planning. The event concluded with clear next steps, including plans for broader adoption, integration into Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions, and future conferences, solidifying the foundation for continuous growth and collaboration in digital education across the continent.


## Background
The second African STACK Conference for Undergraduate Mathematics was conceived as a continuation of the successful first conference, which set the stage for advancing the use of technology in teaching and assessing mathematics across Africa. The initial conference highlighted the pressing need for effective formative assessment and the potential of STACK to address this challenge — the second conference aimed to build on these discussions by deepening engagement with STACK resources and methodologies.
With the [African STACK Community Leadership Team](https://stack-assessment.org/Communities/African_leadership/) in place and access to IDEMS' Open Question Banks, the conference served as a strategic opportunity to drive broader adoption of STACK. It facilitated the exchange of best practices and experiences among educators who implemented STACK, enriching the community's collective knowledge and method.
Additionally, the conference sought to forge international partnerships to evaluate the impact of digital interventions in formative assessment, particularly in low-resourced environments. By leveraging the data and insights gained from STACK's growing adoption in undergraduate courses, the conference aimed to inform and refine the strategies for improving mathematics education.
In essence, the conference built on the foundation laid by the first event, strengthening discussions and collaborations to enhance the use of digital technologies in formative assessment and to promote innovative practices across African universities.
